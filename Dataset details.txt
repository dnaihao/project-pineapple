Datasets: 


There are three datasets we used. The one which we collected manually was called “Jimin’s simulated data”. 


In Jimin’s simulated data, we pretended to be wheelchair users and took photos from different backgrounds. This data is used directly to test our model instead of training due to the small quantity. The regular data includes several activities that all pedestrians would do along the road such as crossing the road and waiting for traffic lights. Additionally, we collected the image of sitting on chairs from different perspectives. Those images were used to make sure our model will not make a judgment based on the people and the postures. Due to Covid-19, we are unable to have 


The other two datasets are used to train the model, Waymo’s Datasets and MobilityAids Datasets. They are collected by the previous team and Humanising Autonomy. Both two datasets are pretty large, however, the data related to wheelchair users is relatively small. Therefore, we could not use the full datasets since the model will simply say everything is not a wheelchair user if the percentage of non-wheelchair-user data is too large.
